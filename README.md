# 📊 Loan Status Prediction

## 📌 Overview
Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications daily, and manually assessing each application can be time-consuming and error-prone.  
This project applies **Machine Learning techniques** to predict loan approval status automatically.  

By analyzing applicant data such as income, credit history, employment details, and loan amount, the model helps in making **faster and more accurate lending decisions**.  
The project not only focuses on predictive modeling but also emphasizes **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering**, making it a complete end-to-end data science solution.
